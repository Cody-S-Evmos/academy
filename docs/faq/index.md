<summary><b>What is a faucet? Where can i find the official Evmos mainnet faucet?</b></summary>

A faucet is an application that dispenses small amounts of cryptocurrencies to users for free. The purpose of a faucet is to introduce new users to a cryptocurrency by giving them a small amount of tokens to play with, and to encourage them to explore the network’s features and potential use cases.

You can claim from the official Evmos faucet in the [faucet channel](https://discord.com/channels/809048090249134080/1030344710205747271) found in our Discord server.
